## Set Up

- Because this will be submitted through a GitHub pull request, fork the sample repository to create your own repository copy.
- Clone the forked repository into your local machine using `$ git clone` in the terminal, remember that this will create a NEW folder with the repository's name that you can then cd into.
- Create 2 new files, an `index.html` and add a script `main.js`.
- Import this JavaScript file in your HTML templatesâ€™s head tag: `<script src='main.js' defer></script>`
- Copy the following prompt into your `main.js` file, add your solution and then continue to the next prompt.
- Test your solutions by logging your variables through the console - `console.log(Variables)` and running `$ node main.js` in the terminal.
