/*
 * Prompt 1:
 *
 * Set the variable simpleMath to a number. In the console.log() multiply that
 * variable by a new number. Do this for division, addition, and subtraction
 * as well using seperate lines and console.logs() for each.
 */

// let simpleMath;

/*  // Example Answer => 
let simpleMath = 101;
console.log(simpleMath*100);
*/



/*
 * Prompt 2:
 *
 * Declare 3 variables using the variable names numberVariable, booleanVariable,
 * and stringVariable. Set each variable to values with the respective data
 * type (number, boolean, and string). Use typeof in your console.log() to 
 * double check your solutions.
 */



/*
 * Prompt 3:
 *
 * Take the following given variables, and using string concatenation, return
 * them as 4 different words.
 */

// let wordPlayR = "r"
// let wordPlayE = "e"
// let wordPlayA = "a"
// let wordPlayD = "d"



/*
 * Prompt 4:
 *
 * Set the given variable's value to a number data type. Then on the next line
 * use string concatenation to display your variable with a new string. This new
 * string can either be in the console.log() or you can set a new variable to
 * your string concatenation.
 */

// let numberString;
